A facebook API for java.

Why another one?  I didn't like the direction and issues that the main facebook-java-api had (casting to unknown objects when making Facebook API calls, using the session key when constructing the client, confusing classes for webapp support, etc). So I started building my own to make it cleaner and less confusing.
